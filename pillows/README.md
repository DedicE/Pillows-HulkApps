# Pillows - React Site with Tailwind and Bootstrap Implementation

Welcome to Pillow Paradise! This is a React website project for a fictional online store that sells a wide variety of pillows. The project is currently in its early stages, and while the core structure is set up, the styling has not been fully implemented yet. We'll be using both Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to make the site visually appealing and responsive.

## Introduction
Pillows is an e-commerce website project that aims to provide a delightful shopping experience for users looking to buy high-quality pillows. The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The site is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, making it enjoyable for users to explore and find their perfect pillows.

## Installation
To run the project locally and start working on the styling, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/DedicE/Pillows-HulkApps)
   cd pillows
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the site by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage
As this project is currently under development, you can begin implementing the styling using both Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. Tailwind CSS provides utility classes to quickly style components, while Bootstrap offers a set of components and styles to enhance the site's look and feel.

The project structure is organized as follows:
```
pillows/
|-- public/
|-- src/
    |-- components/
    |-- assets/
    |-- App.js
    |-- index.js
|-- package.json
|-- ...
```

- `public/`: Contains the index.html and other static assets.
- `src/`: Holds the React components and other related files.
  - `components/`: Includes individual components of the site (e.g., Navbar, Footer, ProductCard, etc.).
  - `App.js`: The main component that composes the site layout and structure.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the React app.

Feel free to modify existing components or create new ones as needed to bring the design to life.

## Technologies
The project is primarily built using the following technologies:

- React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Bootstrap - CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
